### Websites vs. Web Applications
Websites deal with information. Are made to be viewed and browsed. Web apps are more personalized experiences and have a specific goal in mind.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub
Git is version control, tracks changes, good for group work.
We push our Git repository to the Git Hub website.

### Markdown & Documentation
Markdown is the industry standard for Git. It has similarities to the basic structure tags of HTML.
Documentation is important because every change in each programming line could potentially break the whole program. That is why Commit descriptions should be specific and varied.
